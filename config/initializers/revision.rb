# The commit this build came from, so "which revision is actually running?" is
# answerable without guessing.
#
# The Dockerfile writes VERSION at build time from a --build-arg GIT_SHA.
# Outside a container there is no such file, so fall back to asking git — but
# only in development, because shelling out on boot is not something a deployed
# container should do, and it has a VERSION file anyway.
#
# This is deliberately a different thing from Kith::VERSION (config/version.rb):
#
#   version   which release is this? Survives a rebuild of the same code, and is
#             what the image tag is named after.
#   revision  which commit is this? Precise, automatic, meaningless to read, and
#             the only thing that answers "is what I just built actually
#             running?"
